My research is at the intersection of Data Science and Earth science, and high-performance computing. I am interested in analyzing spatio-temporal extremes in carbon fluxes using Observations and Earth System Models to quantify the impact of climate change on potential carbon uptake and carbon sink.

## Bio
I am a [Research Scientist](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/bharat-d-sharma) in the Computational Urban Sciences Group within the [Computational Sciences and Engineering Division](https://www.ornl.gov/division/csed) at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/). My work focuses on the intersection of computational Earth system modeling and critical infrastructure systems, advancing the representation and prediction of complex environmental–infrastructure feedbacks, urban resiliency, and transportation systems by leveraging big data, network science, machine learning, and high-performance computing.

Currently, I am engaged in several multidisciplinary projects, including:
- Modeling forest stand CO<sub>2</sub> and nutrient interactions in the demographically enabled ELM-FATES to improve predictions of terrestrial carbon dynamics under changing environmental conditions
- Investigating the resiliency of transportation networks under targeted and potential climate change disruptions (in collaboration with the University of Tennessee, Knoxville)
- Developing a domain-specific large language model (LLM) for Earth system data


Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Environmental Sciences Division at ORNL. I hold a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Engineering (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering) from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). My academic background includes a Master’s in Transportation Systems from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) and a Bachelor’s in Civil Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur](https://nith.ac.in/). I have also gained industry experience at [Obermeyer](https://www.obermeyer-group.com/) and [New Delhi International Airport](https://www.newdelhiairport.in/).

Beyond research, I enjoy table tennis, cooking, reading, and connecting with friends and family.
