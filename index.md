My research is at the intersection of Data Science and Earth science, and high-performance computing. I am interested in analyzing spatio-temporal extremes in carbon fluxes using Observations and Earth System Models to quantify the impact of climate change on potential carbon uptake and carbon sink.

## Bio

Bharat Sharma is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), Boston. He is currently working as an exchange graduate student at the Climate Change Science Institute at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) with a concentration in understanding the impact of changing climate on the terrestrial carbon cycle. His work focuses on the detection of extreme events in carbon fluxes, under various forcing scenarios using observations and earth system models, and attribution to individual and compound climate drivers. He has a Master’s in Transportation System from the [Technical University of Munich (Germany)](https://www.tum.de/en/) and a Bachelor’s in Civil Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur (India)](https://nith.ac.in/). He has previously worked at [Obermeyer](https://www.obermeyer-group.com/) and [New Delhi International Airport](https://www.newdelhiairport.in/). Bharat spends his spare time cooking, reading, and talking to friends and family.
